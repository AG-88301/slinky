Simulates a falling Slinky.
--

[data.csv](data.csv) contains experimental data we collected (it's not a dependancy for the simulation code).

Each set of data from one drop spans 6 columns: time, zeta = 0, zeta = 0.25, zeta = 0.5, zeta = 0.75, zeta = 1, where zeta is the mass fraction.

33 sets of data are provided, each with 105 frames tracked.
